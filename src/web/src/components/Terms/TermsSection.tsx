        1. Subject of the Contract
      </h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
        The subject of the contract is the access and use of the digital
        platform &quot;Yoma&quot;. Access to its content is only possible for
        registered users. The marketplace supports its users with on- and
        offline opportunities for skills development, social impact and
        employment. A digital CV is generated as users engage on the
        marketplace. It also offers possibilities for exchange between
        registered users in the Yoma community. Additionally, a user can gain
        digital tokens, a quasi currency, which can be redeemed in selected
        partner countries in real local marketplaces (e.g. for transport, data
        bundles and airtime) and in the digital space to access other
        opportunities (e.g. mentoring or more advanced and tutored courses with
        limited intake).
      </p>

      <h2 className="mb-2 text-lg font-bold text-black">2. Context</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
        The platform Yoma is implemented by the non-governmental organisation
        RLabs in South Africa. The platform is supported and sustained by a
        broad partner network lead by UNICEF, Generation Unlimited, Goodwall and
        the Deutsche Gesellschaft f√ºr Internationale Zusammenarbeit (GIZ) GmbH
        on behalf of the Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and
        Development (BMZ) and the European Commission (EC). Yoma is an open
        ecosystem that thrives through its collaboration with both youth and
        ecosystem partners. The opportunities provided on and via Yoma are
        intended to support youth to build an alternative skills and trust
        profile, which enhances employability and allows for more informed
        matching with the labour market.

      </h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
        There are different types of learning, earning and impact opportunities
        provided on Yoma. These opportunities are generally offered by partner
        institutions of Yoma via their own digital services. To access an
        opportunity, an additional registration on the partner&apos;s platform
        may be required. Consequently, the Yoma platform may include links to
        third-party websites, plug-ins and applications. Clicking on those links
        or enabling those connections may allow third parties to collect or
        share data about you. We do not control these third-party websites and
        are not responsible for their privacy statements. Please carefully read
        the partners&apos; Privacy Policy and Terms of Conditions before
        consenting and registering for an opportunity. When you leave our
        website, we encourage you to read the privacy notice of every website
        you visit. Yoma will not pass on any personal data without the express
        consent of the users.

        7. Use of the Information and Privacy
      </h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
        Access to Yoma is only possible for registered users. To provide the
        services of Yoma the user profile of atingi requires personal data.
        Personal data will not be forwarded to third parties. As soon as users
        start the registration process, all data provided or generated by virtue
        of the registration process, is processed. Personal data is any
        information that relates to an identified or identifiable living
        individual (contrary to legal entities). Different pieces of
        information, which collected together can lead to the identification of
        a particular person, also constitute personal data. All personal data

        Regulation. These provisions provide a strict framework for storing and

        we are collecting and processing, the purposes for the collection and
        ways in which we protect your personal data, please refer to our Privacy
        Policy.
      </p>

      <h2 className="mb-2 text-lg font-bold text-black">
        8. Roles and Permission
      </h2>
      <p className="font-bold text-black">Yoma youth</p>
      <p className="mb-4">
        Yoma youth are the holders of their own data and are permitted to engage
        across opportunities, challenges and impact tasks, as well as apply for
        jobs found on Yoma. The Yoma Youth are able to build their own digital
        CV, and share their CV with employers on the platform, in accordance
        with self-determination. They are also able to earn and spend digital
        currency on the marketplace.
      </p>

      <p className=" font-bold text-black">Opportunity Provider (OP)</p>
      <p className="mb-4">
        OPs provide challenges, courses, and tasks for Yoma Youth to engage
        with. They are also responsible for issuing verified credentials to the
        Yoma Youth on successful completion of the challenge, course, or task.
        OPs are not able to initiate contact with Yoma Youth, however once a
        Yoma Youth has applied to take part in a challenge, course or impact
        opportunity, the OP is able to connect with them on their own
        website/platform. OPs do not have access to any youth data unless the
        youth actively initiate a connection with the OP in the form of taking
        part in a challenge. At this point, the OP will be able to view the
        youth member&apos;s name, surname, and email address.
      </p>

      <p className=" font-bold text-black">Employment Provider (EP)</p>
      <p className="mb-4">
        Much like OPs, EPs are not able to initiate a connection with Yoma
        Youth. Rather, the EP lists an employment opportunity for Yoma Youth to
        browse, and only once the Yoma Youth has shown interest and would like
        to form a connection to share their CV, is the EP able to communicate
        with the Yoma Youth. Like the OPs, once the connection is formed between
        the EP and Yoma Youth, the relationship will be managed off the Yoma
        portal, and between the Yoma Youth and EP.
      </p>

      <p className=" font-bold text-black">Yoma Technical Team</p>
      <p className="mb-4">
        This is the design and development team responsible with building and
        maintaining the platform. Only members of this team have access to the
        various databases and user information that is not encrypted. Access to
        the database is done strictly under the request of the Product Owner and
        is limited to the fields specifically needed. This is often done when
        there is a user that is unable to access certain elements or features of
        Yoma, and the technical team is required to troubleshoot against a
        specific username and criteria.
      </p>

      <h2 className="mb-2 text-lg font-bold text-black">
        9. Platform Conduct and Responsibility
      </h2>

        Users undertake to be liable for damages caused by them, indemnify Yoma
        against all claims arising from the infringement of the rights of third
        parties and reimburse Yoma for all costs incurred in this context for
        legal defense measures or due to sanctions imposed by state authorities.
        As soon as users culpably breach legal obligations and provisions
        enshrined in laws or in these terms of use, they shall be liable in
        accordance with the generally applicable statutory provisions.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4">
        Yoma reserves the right to exclude users from access to the platform in
        the event of serious violations of the terms of use stated here. In this
        case, the contract with users will be terminated and they will not be
        able to conclude a new contract for a period of 5 years.

        10. Update of terms &amp; conditions
      </h2>

        The users will be informed about updates of the terms and conditions via
        a notification in the Yoma platform.
      </p>

        11. Deletion of accounts and data
      </h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
        Users can terminate their access to the platform at any time by sending
        a deletion request to the administrator of Yoma. Upon account deletion,
        the contract with Yoma also terminates. Furthermore, after 13 months of
        inactivity, users will be sent a notification. If the users remain
        inactive for an additional period of 6 months after the first
        notification, the account and the contract will be terminated
        automatically. By ending the contractual relationship, the account of
        the user will be deleted and the user cannot access the Yoma platform
        anymore.
