### Project Structure

- This is a [T3 Stack](https://create.t3.gg/) project bootstrapped with `create-t3-app`.
- **Flux** is used for state management and all Flux specific files are located inside `src/flux`. Transitioning to a more robust solution such as Redux is also fairly simple.
- All primary templates are located inside `src/views`.
- There is only one single layout defined (Default) inside `src/layouts`, however, the current structure provides an easy way of extending the UI kit. 
- The `src/components` directory hosts all template-specific subcomponents in their own subdirectory.

- Other extra styles specific to the libraries used are located inside `src/assets`....
- The `src/utils` directory contains generic utilities.
